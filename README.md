# Compilation

First, clone this repository using

```
git clone https://github.com/yudin-yaroslav/flower_CNN.git
```

To compile the project from source run the sequence of commands:

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./main.out
```

# Results

Given 5 flower types, this specific CNN is capable of guessing the correct flower type with the accuracy of 65%.
This is definitely not the most accurate CNN you've ever seen, yet it's fine for the academic purposes.
